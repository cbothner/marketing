Title: Promotion

Text: 

We promote cases both locally and globally. 

Local promotion happens through our podcases broadcast on (link: http://www.hotinhere.us/ text:local radio), where we air the podcast as well as welcoming case authors in studio, then open phone lines for community feedback and questions. 

Broader promotion happens through conferences hosted by some of our partner organizations, where we are able to both showcase existing cases, workshop emerging cases, and solicit case suggestions for future production or for our competition. The first such showcase happened in Baltimore in October 2016  at the American Association for Sustainability in Higher Education or AASHE meetings. A second will happen in Ann Arbor in May at the Association for Law, Property and Society or ALPS meetings, a third in June at the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors or AEES meeting.
