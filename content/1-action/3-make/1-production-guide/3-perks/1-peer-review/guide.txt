Title: Peer-Reviewed Publications

----

Text: 

Individual cases are fast tracked for publication in partner journals. In dialogue with these journals' editors we have negotiated workshop and conference models in support of our case writing teams.  In this way we close the gap that often exists between published teaching cases and peer-reviewed publications, encouraging our case authors to consider publishing the science behind the case, or the science of the case's results in classrooms or other fora.  For an overview publication featuring early assessment data from University of Michigan classrooms, (link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452292916300820 text:see this paper published in June 2016).
