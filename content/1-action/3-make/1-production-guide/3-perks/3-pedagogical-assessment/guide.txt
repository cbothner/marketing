Title: Pedagogical Assessment

----

Text: 

We produce assessment options and results for each of our cases, as they move across disciplines, fields or from year to year in a given classroom. We also evaluate some of the impacts of our project as whole on the learning and teaching cultures of our home and partner institutions. We do this in collaboration with the (link: http://ai.umich.edu/ text:University of Michigan's Academic Innovation program), the (link: http://www.crlt.umich.edu/ text:Center for Research on Teaching and Learning), and our Curricular Advisory group. (link: action/teach/evaluation text: Checkout this page for current assessments).

Further, Rebecca Hardin, Matt Vedrin and Meg Czerwinski have convened a new Rackham Interdisciplinary Workshop Entitled “Methods in the Evaluation and Assessment of Sustainability Research and Education” (or MEASuRE) which brings together staff, faculty, students and visitors whose scholarship focuses on monitoring and evaluations of interventions in educational and development contexts. The science behind case based learning, and what are its benefits for what kinds of learning objectives, and what kinds of learners, is part of what we do.
