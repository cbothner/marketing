<h5>Associate Professor, SNRE</h5>
<p>Dr. Rebecca Hardin provides leadership and visionary thinking for the whole MSC project. Hardin writes and conducts research about histories of human/animal interactions and conservation justice, transnational environmental justice movements, corporate social responsibility in relation to community institutions, and the ways that emergent disease and disease surveillance shapes emergent democracies. Hardin teaches courses at the School of Natural Resources and Environment (SNRE), Program in the Environment (PITE) and Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where she teaches in ways that engage minority students, suit different types of learners, provoke critical thinking, and provide practical skills. </p>

<p>Dr. Hardin got her social theory training at Brown University, doctoral training in social/cultural anthropology at Yale University, and postdoctoral fellowships at the Laboratoire ERMES (IRD and Universite d'Orleans, France) and the Yale Council for International and Area Studies. Hardin was an Academy Scholar at Harvard University, with the focus in media persisted and encountered training in international and area studies. She has taught as a visiting professor at Paris I (Sorbonne) and the National Museum of Natural History, in Paris. She has also taught at McGill University's Department of Anthropology and School of Environment, before moving to Ann Arbor.</p>
